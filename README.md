## About


**Bearing** is a Python Framework for geospatial processing. The collection of modules and tools provides functionality for the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of geographical data, such as vectors and rasters. They may also provide tools for spatial analysis, data conversion, and map projection. The library can be used for a wide range of applications, including remote sensing, location-based services, spatial analysis, data conversion, map projection and automated mapping. 

### Alternatives

Some other popular geospatial libraries in Python include GeoPandas, Fiona, Rasterio, and Shapely. 


## Quick Start

### Installation

pip install bearing
```
```

## Authors

**Bearing** is an open-source project by [Starling Associates](https://www.starling.associates "Starling Associates website").

Starling is a spatial insight, strategy and design bureau that develops regenerative and lively environments with a net-positive impact on our future. We embrace the beautiful complexity of our planet’s ecosystems and use a systemic approach to sustainability, circularity and nature-inclusiveness. We go well beyond the life cycle of the places we design and aim to foster the cycle of life that flows through them. Therefore, we develop innovative instruments that are inspired by natural principles and allow us to generate a deep understanding of the environment. We utilise these constantly evolving insights to develop strategies and designs that serve people, society, economy and the ecologies in which they reside in harmony.
